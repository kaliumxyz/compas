When you use &#39;type&#39; either in the context or in some log message it would be consistent to have it always lower cased.</p><p>This &#39;best practice&#39; is added to make the logs less shouting, and more relaxed \u{1F603} This affected the event callstack logging and the server error logger in the lbu packages.</p><h3 id="store" tabindex="-1">Store <a class="header-anchor" href="#store" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>The store package got it&#39;s much necessary polish. We now floor the average time to job completion, before returning the value in milliseconds. This is the average time between the &#39;scheduledAt&#39; and &#39;updatedAt&#39;.</p><p>&#39;addRecurringJobToQueue&#39; now updates the interval and priority if a job already exists. This saves some custom queries. However, if you need to remove recurring jobs, you&#39;d still need a custom query. The rescheduling had some changes as well. If the &#39;scheduledAt&#39; + interval is still in the past, we add the interval to the current timestamp. This most likely won&#39;t have impact on bigger intervals, however on small intervals and a swamped worker, this may save the day.</p><h3 id="cli" tabindex="-1">Cli <a class="header-anchor" href="#cli" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>The cli by default debounced file changes before restarting your process in watch mode. This debounce effect was also active when doing a manual restart when typing <code>rs&lt;enter&gt;</code>. The latter is removed.</p><h3 id="code-gen" tabindex="-1">Code gen <a class="header-anchor" href="#code-gen" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>A small polishing touch to the type generator makes sure to print the docs of types if they exists.</p><h3 id="in-closing" tabindex="-1">In closing <a class="header-anchor" href="#in-closing" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Another small release with small fixes. As we just started another big project based on LBU you discover new things. It is clear to me that you&#39;d need both maturing projects to see potential &#39;DX scaling&#39; issues, but also new projects with a fresh mind to get as much polishing touch as you can.</p><p>Let&#39;s see if we hit <code>v0.0.100</code> or <code>v0.1.0</code> first!</p>',15),r=[o];function n(l,h,d,c,p,g){return s(),t("div",null,r)}var v=e(i,[["render",n]]);export{m as __pageData,v as default};
